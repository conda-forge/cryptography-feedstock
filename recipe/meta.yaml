  summary: Provides cryptographic recipes and primitives to Python developers
  description: |
    Cryptography is a package which provides cryptographic recipes and
    primitives to Python developers. Our goal is for it to be your
    "cryptographic standard library". It supports Python 2.6-2.7, Python 3.3+,
    and PyPy 2.6+. Cryptography includes both high level recipes, and low level
    interfaces to common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers,
    message digests and key derivation functions.
