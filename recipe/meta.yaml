  summary: cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers.
  description: |
    cryptography is a package which provides cryptographic recipes and
    primitives to Python developers. Our goal is for it to be your
    "cryptographic standard library". It supports Python 3.6+ and PyPy3 7.2+.
    cryptography includes both high level recipes and low level interfaces
    to common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, message
    digests, and key derivation functions..
